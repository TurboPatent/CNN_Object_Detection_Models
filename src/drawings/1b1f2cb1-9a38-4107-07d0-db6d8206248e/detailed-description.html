<p>The Image classification models&nbsp;classify images into a single category, usually corresponding to the most salient object. Photos and videos are usually complex and contain multiple objects. This being said, assigning a label with image classification models may become tricky and uncertain. Object detection models are therefore more appropriate to identify multiple relevant objects in a single image. The second significant advantage of object detection models versus image classification ones is that localization of the objects may be provided.</p>
<p>Some of the model that may be utilized to perform&nbsp;image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation include but are not limited to,&nbsp;Region-based Convolutional Network&nbsp;(R-CNN), Fast Region-based Convolutional Network (Fast&nbsp;R-CNN), Faster Region-based Convolutional Network (Faster&nbsp;R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network&nbsp;(R-FCN), You Only Look Once&nbsp;(YOLO),&nbsp;Single-Shot Detector&nbsp;(SSD), Neural Architecture Search Net&nbsp;(NASNet), and Mask Region-based Convolutional Network (Mask&nbsp;R-CNN).</p>
<p>These models may utilize a variety of training datasets that include but are not limtied to&nbsp;PASCAL Visual Object Classification (PASCAL VOC) and Common Objects in COntext (COCO)&nbsp;datasets.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;PASCAL Visual Object Classification (PASCAL VOC)&nbsp;dataset is a well-known dataset for object detection, classification, segmentation of objects and so on. There are around 10 000 images for training and validation containing bounding boxes with objects. Although, the PASCAL VOC dataset contains only 20 categories, it is still considered as a reference dataset in the object detection problem.</p>
<p>ImageNet has released an object detection dataset since 2013 with bounding boxes. The training dataset is composed of around 500 000 images only for training and 200 categories.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Common Objects in COntext (COCO)&nbsp;datasets were developed by Microsoft. This dataset is used for caption generation, object detection, key point detection and object segmentation. The COCO object detection consists in localizing the objects in an image with bounding boxes and categorizing each one of them between 80 categories.</p>
